# art, in the end

### foreword
ai is a mosquito. it's something i've made a conscious effort to stay away from as a ~~software engineer~~ someone who codes, yet something that it seems impossible to truly avoid in the current day and age. i'm conflicted about it.

i used to love using ai dungeon back in ~2020, when it was still powered by gpt-2. it wasn't mindblowing or anything, i know about natural language processing, but its hallucinations actually felt really compelling to me. i'm sure you know the deal by now: random context changes, repeating phrases over and over, complete logical failures were characteristic of the model, and it's something we continued to see in 3.5 as well as later early versions of LLaMa and other models before they got better at filtering it out. more on this later. i thought ai would always be a text based thing - an evolution of nlp methods - and i was very, very wrong.

when i got to college i found out i'd have to take english classes and in a way i saw that as 'beneath me'. i would say i'm not sure why i thought that, maybe i thought it was a targeted international student thing. i can read, damn it. turns out that english isn't standardized here, and different instructors teach it differently. mine was an artist and art curator, and i feel i learnt a lot. this post is me summarizing and attempting to communicate what changed, for me. soon after that class, dall-e 2 launched in april 2022.

let's start talking about art - i'm not going to make an attempt here to define what constitutes art, and will mostly be working in the framework of visual art, both classical/traditional and modern/digital. i'm bad at arguing, but i'm here to argue, so i'll be talking about a few topics and letting you connect the dots. first, the image above.
