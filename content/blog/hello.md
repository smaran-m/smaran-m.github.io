# my name is <span style="color:#ffa07a">Smaran</span>.
I am a first-year MSCS student based in Atlanta, GA 🐝. I have a variety of interests that will hopefully be evident when I get around to writing blog posts.

you can look at my creative projects with your eye(s) [here](https://sammi.sh)<br>
you can look at my code with your computer(s) [here](https://github.com/smaran-m)

hire me! [my resume](/docs/SmaranMishraResume.pdf).

# this is my website.
there are many like it, but this one is mine.

it was designed to be quick and concise. most text is lowercase just because i prefer it that way.
i built it myself, with a little help from my friend [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

enjoy your stay ♡
