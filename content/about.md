# my name is <span style="color:#ffa07a">Smaran</span>.
I am a first-year MSCS student based in Atlanta, GA üêù. I like making well designed technology to help people work and feel better. While my specialization is in systems and multimedia, I also like working on tools and testing - I ESPECIALLY like when these areas mix.
