      <description>I have a lot of nostalgia for games that I have never played. You know those fake games that they would put on in an episode of a 90s sitcom or something which had generic fantasy tropes, but nothing identifiable enough to get them sued? Or that episode where characters dress up to play D&amp;amp;D (which I found out way too late that no one does irl)? I miss those games.</description>

      <description>Dunjin (working title) is a WIP multiplayer platform fighter using Godot ver 3.5.3. The game is currently in a prototype state.
Motivation I wanted to make the TTRPG combat experience more enjoyable, using medieval themes but a real time battle system that allows for a high skill ceiling. I&amp;rsquo;m using a smash archetype for the character controller, but plan to have this as both a single-player and multiplayer game. This is currently a solo project: I did all the art and code, but the parallax background behind the windows was sourced from here.</description>

      <description>Ripples Live Demo Check out sammi.sh. This also functions as my creative project website, and will be updated occasionally.
Motivations I&amp;rsquo;m still obsessed with ASCII art and textmode, but recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to learn a bit more about procedural content. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into simple procedural animations with inverse kinematics for an independent game project, and thought I&amp;rsquo;d showcase some of that over on my creative project website.</description>

      <description>Usage  build with dotnet build run with dotnet run click and drag to fill in squares select tileset with dropdown menu generate!  Features  doodle around and generate tilemaps that work great for games and TTRPGs generates almost instantaneously, make quick changes on the fly save and load grid states as JSON files edit tileset at will in any image editor of your choice (resources/tilesets/)  Motivations So I played around with an evolution sim in python back in high-school, but never got past the stage of procedurally generated levels.</description>

      <description>Usage  install PIL: pip install pillow run the script images will be output to ./out  Examples supports different quality outputs: Motivations A few years ago, I found out about donut.c which was equal parts artistry and wizardry to me. I really liked the look of it, growing up surrounded by ASCII art on obscure forums.
Recently, reminded of this, I wrote a script to automatically convert images to similar kinds of art.</description>
