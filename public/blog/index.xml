      <description>I have a lot of nostalgia for games that I have never played. You know those fake games that they would put on in an episode of a 90s sitcom or something which had generic fantasy tropes, but nothing identifiable enough to get them sued? Or that episode where characters dress up to play D&amp;amp;D (which I found out way too late that no one does irl)? I miss those games.</description>

      <description>my name is Smaran. I am a first-year MSCS student based in Atlanta, GA üêù. I like making well designed technology to help people work and feel better. While my specialization is in systems and multimedia, I also like working on tools and testing - I ESPECIALLY like when these areas mix.
